        <h2>About Jonesy James Christmas:</h2>
        <div id="jonesy-story">
            <p>Jonesy had a hard start as a kitten, he was seperated from his mother too early, had fleas, warms and stomach bug that caused him wamiting, diarrhea and overall he was a weak and ill kitten, when we took him in. </p>
            <p>Now he has a health insurance and a very good vet who knows us well, as Jonesy is a trouble maker. 
                We are living in the UK and in a very safe area, so we let Jonesy out, however he keeps on finding new problems. 
                First he had his paw cut, then caught a bug that caused him extreme discomfort, so he was peeing blood. All of that was not cheap, as the vet bills in the UK are very high.
                We love him to the moon and back and at this point I am basically working to provide a better life for my cat and pay all the vet bills.
            </p>
            <p>
                Recently our TikTok channel got monitised and we are not making a lot of money there, however what we are making is enough to cover our monthly donation to different charities and we are happy to do so. 
                If you wish to contact us in order to get payed commersial on our channel please use contact us form. 50% of add revenue will go towards other cat charities and cats in general and the rest will help us to cover any emergency vet bills.
